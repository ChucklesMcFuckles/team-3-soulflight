# Soulflight by Team 3
GitHub Repo for Senior Project/Capstone

I currently own the most recent files and updated version of the game.
Github couldn't handle the size of our files, and no one else was interested in working on the game after the prototype's submission. Any further edits will be done by me and any others I feel could help improve the nature of the game.

It's a 3D Rogue Lite dungeon crawler with a rendering shader that calls back to the era of PS1 and PS2 games with their low poly and pixelated aesthetic.
The player will be able to build themselves a character and it should be saved and transitioned into gameplay for future runs, or allow the player to make a new character.
There'll be a variety of weapons to pick from with varying stats and attacks to pit against the hordes of the mad god. Currently the combat needs a complete implementation and rehaul as well as a few more unique monsters to fight.
